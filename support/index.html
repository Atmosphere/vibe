        <h2>Professional Support</h2>
        <p>Vibe is, and forever will be, open source as Vibe is distributed under the Apache 2 license, one of the most flexible open source licenses. But because choosing a technology like Vibe is a kind of long-term investment, you need to be convinced of a better expected value for that investment. That's why, we offer commercial support.<p>
        <p>The creator of Vibe offers professional support for <a href="/projects/vibe-protocol/">Vibe Protocol</a>, <a href="/projects/vibe-java-server/">Vibe Java Server</a>, <a href="/projects/vibe-javascript-client/">Vibe JavaScript Client</a> and <a href="/projects/vibe-java-platform/">Vibe Java Platform</a> through <a href="http://async-io.org/">Async-IO</a>, the official sponsor of Vibe. Please visit <a href="http://async-io.org/subscription.html">Async-IO</a> for the details if you are interested. You can also propose your own request like adding custom feature or prioritizing specific features.</p>
