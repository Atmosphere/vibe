        <h4 class="subheader">A real-time web application framework</h4>
        <p><strong>Vibe</strong> is a new web framework to write low-latency, event-driven, real-time web application and service based on its own protocol built over HTTP and WebSocket <sup><strong>A</strong></sup>, not just a disposable framework to write chat application. <strong>Vibe</strong> focuses on providing reliable full duplex connection and making the best use of it for modern web application development so that teams can focus on application-level business logic and event handling without unnecessary ties to low-level details like transport mechanisms and message loss. <sup><strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong></sup></p>
        <p>It has started as Atmosphere 3, a collaboration of Atmosphere by Jeanfrancois Arcand and Portal by Donghwan Kim by taking advantage of both projects, but as its synergy effect, <strong>Vibe</strong> is birthed.</p>
