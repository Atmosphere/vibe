        <p>Vibe is a new web framework to write low-latency, event-driven, real-time web application and service based on its own protocol built over HTTP and WebSocket, not just a disposable framework to write chat application. Vibe focuses on providing reliable full duplex connection and making the best use of it for modern web application development so that teams can focus on application-level business logic and event handling without unnecessary ties to low-level details like transport mechanisms and message loss.</p>
        <p>It has started as Atmosphere 3, a collaboration of Atmosphere by Jeanfrancois Arcand and Portal by Donghwan Kim by taking advantage of both projects, but as its synergy effect, Vibe is birthed.</p>
