            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The React is a new web framework to write real-time web application and service based on its own protocol built over HTTP and WebSocket, not just a disposable framework to write chat application. React focuses on providing reliable full duplex connection and making the best use of it for modern web application development so that teams can focus on event handling without unnecessary ties to details in transport mechanisms.</p>
            <p>It has started as Atmosphere 3, a collaboration of Atmosphere by Jeanfrancois Arcand and Portal by Donghwan Kim by taking advantage of both projects, but as its synergy effect, React is birthed.</p>
