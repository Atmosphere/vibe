			<p>The <strong>wes</strong> (Web Event Source) is an event-driven abstraction layer for various web application platforms that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. An embeddable web application written with <strong>wes</strong> can run on any supported platform, on Java, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of application and users can choose the desired framework to run application.</p>

		<h2>Write once, run anywhere</h2>
		<p>Servlet specification had been designed to bring this paradigm to web applications, but it could not have lasted long. Because of the lack of support of asynchronous I/O, uncomfortable API, poor productivity and so on, many platform and application framework arose to replace or drop Servlet. That's why author have had to specify application's target platform and do more work to support others. By the same token, while I have developed embeddable web application, Java implementation of <a href="http://flowersinthesand.github.io/portal-java/">Portal</a>, I have written abstract class for application and concrete class for platform. When I start to develop something similar I realized they are not reusuable in this time so decided to create an abstraction layer for web application platform allowing application to run on as many platform as possible. It is the <strong>wes</strong>.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>That being said, wes is not a silver bullet.</p>
		<h3>Write once, debug everywhere</h3>
		<p>As you already know, <em>Run anywhere</em> makes inevitable <em>Debug everywhere</em>. Even though wes is guaranteed to work with a framework you use, it can't ensure your application will work as expected on every platform wes support. You should test your application on each platform you will support.</p>
		<h3>Full-stack frameworks are from Mars, Platforms are from Venus</h3>
		<p>When it comes to interface to handle HTTP and WebSocket, full-stack frameworks such as Play tend to have very simplified API but platform such as Netty which actually is Play's platform tend to have very delicate API. Therefore, interfaces provided by wes are limited to their intersection and may be less rich than you expect and some full-stack frameworks are so picky that you need to handle them directly.</p>
