jQuery team has [mentioned](http://blog.jquery.com/2014/04/02/browser-support-in-jquery-1-12-and-beyond/) about future changes in browser support with Microsoft ending Windows XP support a month ago. Accordingly React JavaScript Client will reduce browser coverage. As they already said, **don't panic!** It will happen 2014 end or early 2015.

Browsers to be not supported are Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Opera 12.1x, Safari 5.1 and Android 2 and 3. So the new browser support table will be:

| Internet Explorer | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Opera | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8+ | (Current - 1) or Current | (Current - 1) or Current | (Current - 1) or Current | (Current - 1) or Current | 6.0+ | 4.0+ |

To put it more concretely, Internet Explorer 6 and 7 and Android 2 and 3 will not work certainly but Opera 12.1x and Safari 5.1 will probably work though it is not guaranteed by test. For those who worry this, I will create a plugin to support the ancient unofficially. But it won't guarantees to work in the future.
