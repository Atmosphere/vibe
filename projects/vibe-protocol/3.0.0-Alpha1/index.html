title: Vibe Protocol
---

<p>Vibe Protocol is a feature-rich and application-level protocol built over HTTP and WebSocket protocol for real-time web application development. <sup><strong>A</strong></sup> It is designed by carefully considering known issues and best practices of real-time web based on web standards <sup><strong>B</strong></sup> to provide a reliable full duplex connection <sup><strong>C</strong></sup> and focus on providing elegant patterns to write low-latency, event-driven and real-time web applications. <sup><strong>D</strong></sup> Moreover, it provides the test suite to verify your client or server implementation. <sup><strong>E</strong></sup></p>

    <dt>A</dt>
    <dd>In a nutshell, what the protocol specifies is a channel built over web allowing to send and receive event in real-time.</dd>
    <dt>B</dt>
    <dd>As component of the specification, RFC and W3C standards like HTTP, WebSocket, Server-Sent Events and JSON are adopted. You don't need to do much to implement the protocol. Just use existing implementation.</dd>
    <dt>C</dt>
    <dd>This part defines the necessary things like event, socket, transport which are required to establish a reliable full duplex connection.</dd>
    <dt>D</dt>
    <dd>This part defines optional extensions like reply and connection sharing which represent a pattern making modern web application development fast and enjoyable.</dd>
    <dt>E</dt>
    <dd>You don't need to take trouble to demonstrate your implementation works correctly. Just show test arguments and its result.</dd>
