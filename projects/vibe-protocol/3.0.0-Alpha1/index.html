title: Vibe Protocol
---

<p>Vibe Protocol is a protocol based on web standards <sup><strong>A</strong></sup> to provide reliable full duplex connection over HTTP <sup><strong>B</strong></sup> and elegant patterns to write real-time web applications <sup><strong>C</strong></sup>. Also it provides the test suite to verify your client or server implementation. <sup><strong>D</strong></sup></p>

<dl>
    <dt>A</dt>
    <dd>As component of the specification, RFC and W3C standards like HTTP, WebSocket, Server-Sent Events and JSON are adopted. You don't need to do much to implement the protocol. Just use existing implementation.</dd>
    <dt>B</dt>
    <dd>This part defines transports for interacting with HTTP connections and socket for exchanging events between two endpoints on the top of transport.</dd>
    <dt>C</dt>
    <dd>This part defines optional extensions which represent patterns making modern web application development fast and enjoyable.</dd>
    <dt>D</dt>
    <dd>You don't need to take trouble to demonstrate your implementation works correctly. Just show test arguments and result.</dd>
