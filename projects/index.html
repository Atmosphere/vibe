        <h2>Getting involved</h2>
        <p>Getting involved is definitely the most dominant driving force of Vibe like any other open source project. Actually Vibe has started since someone who wrote Yet Another Atmosphere shared <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/atmosphere-framework/6e5owL9_WPU/_Wbp3_dk7rUJ">small experience</a> as an effort to make Atmosphere the better project. There are lots of ways you can do.</p>
        <h3>Share experience</h3>
        <p>Do you have any idea or feel something goes wrong so want to start a war? Just tell us what you think via <a href="https://twitter.com/vibe_project">@vibe_project</a> or <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework">Groups</a> then we will respond. If you wrote some article about Vibe, that's perfect. Let us know your work and we will review if possible and link it. Also you can share knowledge by asking and answering questions on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework">Groups</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vibe">StackOverflow</a> and can participate in conversations about issues on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework">Groups</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere?query=vibe">our GitHub repositories</a>.</p>
        <h3>Report bugs</h3>
        <p>If you are sure it is a Vibe bug, browse relevant project's issue tracker and file an issue following the project's CONTRIBUTING.md if it has not reported. If you are not sure, post a question for that to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework">Groups</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vibe">StackOverflow</a> instead to confirm it is indeed a bug in Vibe. If you have no time to dig it deeply, you don't need to show sincerity when posting a question. Though a lack of sincerity will result in low priority, it doesn't mean we will ignore it.</p>
        <h3>Commit your work</h3>
        <p>The fact is only a few people are willing to spend their precious time to do this kind of contribution for everyone. Hence we will never reject your effort for trivial reason like no test, code style, commit message and branch name as long as your work is <strong>reasonable</strong>. For those trivial things, we will ask you to fix them through review but if you are busy or it's annoying you, just tell us then we will fork, trim and push your work if you agree. Nevertheless, note that <strong>what you do defines you</strong>.</p>
        <p>For a complicated and time consuming work like new feature, we need to discuss it on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework">Groups</a> first and then pull request of relevant GitHub repository enough for you to avoid wasting too much time and to lead Vibe to the desired way the community thinks.</p>
