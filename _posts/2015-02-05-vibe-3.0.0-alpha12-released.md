To allow to exchange binary message through HTTP streaming transport, [Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha12](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha12/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha13](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha13/) and [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha15](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha15/) are released.

* HTTP streaming transport should allow to exchange binary message. Each issue has a comment to demonstrate how to use that feature.  [vibe-protocol#56](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/56), [vibe-java-server#78](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/78), [vibe-javascript-client#53](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/53)
* In HTTP long polling transport, messages that the server couldn't send and cached might be not sent again and lost. [vibe-protocol#57](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/57), [vibe-java-server#79](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/79)  
* Lock all events except close if close event is fired. [vibe-javascript-client#54](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/54)

As of this release, all transports allow to exchange binary message. Now the question is how to utilize this feature on socket, which is called [binary event](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/53). If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
