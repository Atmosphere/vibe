For the simplicity of how to bridge application and platform, [Vibe Java Platform 3.0.0-Alpha9](/projects/vibe-java-platform/3.0.0-Alpha9/) is released.

* A way to bridge application and platform is changed from implementing `httpAction` and `wsAction` to calling `httpAction` and `wsAction`. [vibe-java-platform#40](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/40)
* In Netty, unaccepted request is now passed to next handler. [vibe-java-platform#42](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/42)
