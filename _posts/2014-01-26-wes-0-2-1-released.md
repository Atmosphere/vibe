# wes 0.2.1 released

Servlet support expands from 3.1 to 3.0 so that `wes-atmosphere2` and `wes-servlet3` are able to work with Servlet 3.0 containers. There are many differences between two specs but a thing affecting wes is that reading body is done in a synchronous manner in 3.0 and in a asynchronous manner in 3.1. That's all.

Accordingly, Servlet 3.0 containers are added to the [servlet3-test](https://github.com/flowersinthesand/wes-servlet3-test) subproject.
