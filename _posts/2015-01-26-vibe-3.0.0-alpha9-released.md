Focusing on API for client-side transport layer, [Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha9](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha9/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha10](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha10/) and [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha12](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha12/) are released. Now you can create and use [your own transport](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha10/api/#transports-:---uri:-string--options:-transportoptions-----transport---) and replace default implementations with them completely together with API for server-side transport layer.

* API for client-side transport layer is added and accordingly `transports` option is added, which is a set of transport factories. [vibe-protocol#50](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/50), [vibe-javascript-client#44](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/44)
* URI for WebSocket transport should start with either `ws` or `wss` only. [vibe-protocol#51](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/51), [vibe-javascript-client#43](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/43)
