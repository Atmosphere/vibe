I'm exicted to release [Vibe protocol 3.0.0-Alpha4](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha4/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha4](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha4/) and [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha6](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha6/) after a long time. This release focuses on reorganization of transport.

* Transport is reorganized into `ws`, `stream` and `longpoll`. [vibe-protocol#38](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/38), [vibe-java-server#61](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/61), [vibe-javascript-client#32](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/32)
* Socket has no identifier so that related methods are removed. [vibe-protocol#39](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/39)
* Connection sharing feature is dropped. [vibe-javascript-client#34](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/34)
* `Socket.close` and `Sentence.close` return `void`. [vibe-java-server#62](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/62)
* `stream` transport is fixed in Safari 5 and 6. [vibe-javascript-client#35](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/35)

In next phase, we will focus on making transport public interface. Then, you will be able to customize existing transports and write your own transports e.g. TCP transport. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
