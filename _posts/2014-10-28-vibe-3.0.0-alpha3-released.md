I'm happy to to release Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha3, Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha3, Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha3 and Vibe Java Platform 3.0.0-Alpha2. The main focus of this release is [**error handling**](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/10), a consistent way to deal with error.

* Error handling. [vibe-java-platform#10](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/10), [vibe-protocol#36](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/36), [vibe-java-server#54](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/54), [vibe-javascript-client#29](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/29)
* If sending event fails, now it tries again automatically as long as the socket is opened. [vibe-protocol#37](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/37), [vibe-javascript-client#31](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/31)
* `closeAction` is fixed to use once and memory [vibe-java-server#56](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/56)
* The life cycle of `ServerHttpExchange` is clarified. [vibe-java-platform#15](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/15)

In next phase, we will complete the life cycle of `ServerHttpExchange` through [explicit read method](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/12), [reading request by chunk](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/14) and [handling binary](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/1). Then, we will be able to create bridge for other platforms like Netty. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
