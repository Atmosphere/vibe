To allow to exchange binary message through WebSocket transport, [Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha10](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha10/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha11](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha11/) and [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha13](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha13/) are released.

* WebSocket transport should be able to exchange binary message. Each issue has a comment to demonstrate how to use that feature. [vibe-protocol#52](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/52), [vibe-java-server#76](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/76)
    * It is decided to use only `ArrayBuffer` as a type representing binary data in browser not just for WebSocket but also for other transports. [vibe-javascript-client#48](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/48)
* options.xdrURL may throw a TypeError 'Cannot read property 'xdrURL' of undefined'. [vibe-javascript-client#47](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/47)

This feature is one of sub tasks of [exchange of binary event via socket](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/53). In next iteration, we will focus on how to facilitate exchange of binary message via HTTP transports. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
