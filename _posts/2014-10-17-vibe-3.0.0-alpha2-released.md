It's my pleasure to announce the second alpha of Vibe Protocol, Vibe JavaScript Client and Vibe Java Server. The main focus of this release is [**handshaking**](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/13), an entry point for authentication and protocol negotiation.

* Handshaking. [vibe-protocol#13](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/13), [vibe-java-server#52](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/52), [vibe-javascript-client#25](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/25)
* `abort` request is triggered on `ws` transport as well. [vibe-protocol#35](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/35), [vibe-javascript-client#26](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/26)
* The protocol test suite can be configured by command line arguments now. [vibe-protocol#30](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/30)

In Alpha3, we will focus on [how to capture and handle exception](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/10) thrown all over the place. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
