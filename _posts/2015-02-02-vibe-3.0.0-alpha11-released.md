To allow to exchange binary message through HTTP long polling transport, [Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha11](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha11/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha12](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha12/) and [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha14](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha14/) are released.

* HTTP long polling transport should allow to exchange binary message. Each issue has a comment to demonstrate how to use that feature.  [vibe-protocol#54](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/54), [vibe-java-server#77](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/77)
    * As for binary feature, we decided to drop supporting browsers where XMLHttpRequest 2 and Typed Arrays are not available, i.e. IE 6, 7, 8 and 9. [vibe-javascript-client#49](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/49)

In next iteration, likewise, how to facilitate exchange of binary message via HTTP streaming transport will be covered as a sub task of [exchange of binary event via socket](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/53) and its browser support will follow the one of the above HTTP long polling transport. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
