Focusing on enhancements of longpoll transport and so on, [Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha7](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha7/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha7](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha7/), [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha10](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha10/) and [Vibe Java Platform 3.0.0-Alpha8](/projects/vibe-java-platform/3.0.0-Alpha8/) are released.

* Use of unnecessary message format in `longpoll` transport is removed. [vibe-protocol#47](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/47), [vibe-javascript-client#41](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/41), [vibe-java-server#70](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/70)
* When the underlying connection of `longpoll` transaport is terminated, it fires close event immediately. [vibe-protocol#46](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/46), [vibe-java-server#70](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/70)
* Now transport underlying socket and resource underlying transport are accessible through through `unwrap` method. [vibe-java-server#67](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/67)
* `finishAction` representing the end of the response is added and accordingly now `closeAction` is called only when the underlying connection is terminated. [vibe-java-platform#39](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-platform/issues/39)

In next iteration, [authentication](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/25) will be covered as you have noticed. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
