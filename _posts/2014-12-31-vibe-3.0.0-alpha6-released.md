For the last day of 2014, [Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha6](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha6/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha6](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha6/) and [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha9](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha9/) are released. At first, we tried to design interfaces to make use of transport layer e.g. to build another protocol on top of transport layer but it took so much time so we decided to do that on beta. However, now that `Transport` is a public interface, you can do that by referring current implementations.

* `transports` option is replaced with URI and accordingly `vibe.open`'s [new signature](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha6/api/#export-function-open-uris:-string----options-:-socketoptions-:-socket) is introduced to accept multiple URIs. [vibe-protocol#44](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/44), [vibe-javascript-client#38](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/38)
* `org.atmosphere.vibe.server` package is renamed to `org.atmosphere.vibe`. [vibe-java-server#66](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/66)

In next iteration, how to authenticate will be covered. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
