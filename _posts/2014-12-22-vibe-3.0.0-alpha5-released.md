Focusing on the transport calculation, [Vibe Protocol 3.0.0-Alpha5](/projects/vibe-protocol/3.0.0-Alpha5/), [Vibe JavaScript Client 3.0.0-Alpha5](/projects/vibe-javascript-client/3.0.0-Alpha5/) and [Vibe Java Server 3.0.0-Alpha7](/projects/vibe-java-server/3.0.0-Alpha7/) are released.

* Now transport's availability is calculated by try and error as well as by feature detection. Therefore, given environment if one of transports can work, it will really work automagically so from now on you don't need to even know what transport is. [vibe-protocol#14](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/14), [vibe-java-server#63](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-java-server/issues/63), [vibe-javascript-client#37](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-javascript-client/issues/37)

In fact, this feature is one of issues derived from [making transport public](https://github.com/vibe-project/vibe-protocol/issues/41) we are focusing and will focus on. If you have any feedback, please [let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/atmosphere-framework) and we really appreciate them.
